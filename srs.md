Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
Project: HTML Sharer
Version: 1.0
Date: July 31, 2025

1. Introduction
   1.1. Purpose
   This document provides a detailed description of the functional and non-functional requirements for the "HTML Sharer" web application. The project's goal is to build a minimalist tool that allows users to quickly share a static HTML page by pasting its source code or uploading a file, in return for a unique, shareable URL.

1.2. Scope
The product is a standalone web application.

In-Scope:

Providing an interface for users to paste HTML source code.

Providing a feature for users to upload an .html file.

The system will automatically generate a unique slug for each submission.

Storing the HTML content and its corresponding slug.

Accurately rendering the HTML content when a user visits the generated URL.

A simple, intuitive user interface targeted at both technical and non-technical users.

Out-of-Scope (for Version 1.0):

User account management (registration, login).

Editing or deleting previously created links.

Visit tracking or analytics.

Custom domain support.

Uploading dependent assets like CSS, JS, or image files. (The HTML content is assumed to be self-contained or use resources from public CDNs).

1.3. Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
SRS: Software Requirements Specification.

HTML: HyperText Markup Language.

Slug: A short, unique, URL-friendly string used to identify a resource (e.g., aB3xY7z).

End-User: Anyone who uses the application to share or view HTML content.

Non-technical User: A user with no programming knowledge who needs a simple tool to share a file.

2. Overall Description
   2.1. Product Perspective
   HTML Sharer is a public, installation-free web utility. It addresses the need for quickly sharing UI mockups, HTML-based reports, or simple static websites without the complexity of traditional hosting services or Git knowledge.

2.2. Product Functions
FUNC-1: HTML Content Ingestion: The system can accept HTML content from two sources: directly pasted text and an uploaded .html file.

FUNC-2: Link Generation and Provision: The system processes the received content, generates a unique identifier (slug), and constructs a full, shareable URL.

FUNC-3: HTML Content Rendering: The system can serve the stored HTML content accurately when a user accesses the corresponding URL.

2.3. User Characteristics
Developers / Designers: Need to quickly share UI prototypes, result pages, or HTML snippets with colleagues or clients.

Non-technical Users: Data analysts, students, or anyone needing to share a report or document exported as an HTML page.

2.4. Constraints
The backend must be built using the Go programming language.

The database must be SQLite to ensure portability and zero-configuration setup.

The user interface should have a Single Page Application (SPA) feel, with dynamic interactions that do not require a full page reload.

2.5. Assumptions and Dependencies
Users will access the application with a modern web browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript.

User-submitted HTML content is assumed to be safe. The system will not perform malware scanning.

The HTML content is self-contained. Any external resources (CSS, JS, images) must be linked from public servers (CDNs), as the system will not host these assets.

3. Specific Requirements
   3.1. Functional Requirements
   REQ-FUNC-001: Home Page Interface Display

Description: When accessing the application's root URL, the system must display a simple interface.

Details:

1.1. It must contain a large textarea for users to paste HTML source code.

1.2. It must contain a file input element (<input type="file">) for users to select a file from their local machine.

1.3. It must contain a "Create Link" button (or similar) to submit the form.

1.4. It must contain an empty area designated for displaying the result (the generated link) after submission.

REQ-FUNC-002: Form Submission Processing

Description: The system must process data submitted from the user form.

Details:

2.1. The system shall prioritize content from the textarea if both the textarea and file input contain data.

2.2. If the textarea is empty, the system will process the uploaded file.

2.3. The system should validate that the uploaded file has an .html extension (optional but recommended).

2.4. If no content is provided in either field, the system must display an error message to the user.

REQ-FUNC-003: Link Generation and Storage

Description: Upon receiving valid HTML content, the system must generate and store it.

Details:

3.1. The system must generate a random, unique slug of 8-10 alphanumeric characters.

3.2. The system must save the slug and the entire raw HTML content to the SQLite database.

REQ-FUNC-004: Result Display to User

Description: The system must present the successful link creation result to the user.

Details:

4.1. After a successful database save, the system must display the full shareable URL (e.g., https://your-domain.com/generated-slug) in the result area on the home page.

4.2. This update must occur without a full page reload.

4.3. The displayed URL must be a clickable link that opens in a new tab.

REQ-FUNC-005: Accessing and Rendering the Shared HTML Page

Description: When a GET request is made to a URL containing a slug, the system must serve the corresponding HTML content.

Details:

5.1. The system shall parse the slug from the request URL.

5.2. The system shall query the database for a record matching the slug.

5.3. If found, the system must respond with an HTTP 200 OK status, a Content-Type header of text/html, and the raw stored HTML as the response body.

5.4. If not found, the system must respond with a user-friendly 404 Not Found error page.

3.2. Non-Functional Requirements
REQ-NFR-001: Performance

The home page load time must be under 2 seconds on a broadband connection.

The time from when a user clicks "Create Link" to when the result is displayed must be under 1 second.

REQ-NFR-002: Usability

The interface must be extremely minimalist and self-explanatory, requiring no user manual.

The application must have a responsive design, functioning correctly on both desktop and mobile devices.

Clear status indicators (e.g., processing, success, failure) must be provided.

REQ-NFR-003: Security

The system must not execute any server-side code from the user's HTML content. The content must be treated as plain text on the backend.

User-submitted content should be rendered in a sandboxed context to prevent it from interfering with the main application's UI (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS mitigation).

REQ-NFR-004: Reliability

The service should be available 24/7 with a target uptime of 99.5%.

The SQLite database must be backed up periodically (requirement for a production environment).
